**Pharmacologic Drug modeling of Levetiracetam**


---

Epilepsy is a disorder characterized by unprovoked seizures and is often treated with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs).   
Levetiracetam is an AED used for generalized epilepsy in adults and pediatrics, and is given orally.   
Levetiracetam is pharmacokinetically modeled using a one-compartment-model including first-order absorption and clearance.

**Incidence:** Epilepsy affects 65 million individuals worldwide and places a major burden in seizure-related disability, mortality, comorbidities, stigma, and costs â€‹

**Methods:**   


*  Pharmacokinetic Model

*  Pharmacodynamic Model

*  Population Variability Analysis
*  Missed Dose Analysis

*  Interactive app visualization
